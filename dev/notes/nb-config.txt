neteans wants a site root folder or src folder specified but not mandatory. the same is mandatory
for the html/js application.

in both case if not site root folder is specified then the project root folder is assumed the site
root folder.

scss source to compile with ruby must be in the site root directory and needs to be specified in the
css preprocessor panel without the site root directory name but with slash. for example..

site root and project root: AmazAffCloneNode
scss folder is in: AmazAffCloneNode/public/css/scss and AmazAffCloneNode/dev/experim/public/dev/css/scss

so the path must be: /public/css/scss and /dev/experim/public/dev/css/scss

when site root folder was just public directory inside AmazAffCloneNode then
in case of the second folder the path reference to it with uplift (../) notation didn't work. then 
i had to change the site folder from 'public' to 'AmazAffCloneNode'

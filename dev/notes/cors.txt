i am compelled by netbeans to set up site root folder or source folder which is inside the project root folder to begin an
html/js app. netbeans takes the index.js file from only site root folder.

if i set the porject folder as site root in this netbeans html/js application then cross origin problem occures in browser.
that means if any file residing one level up other then the site root folder then that file such as any 'js module file'
doesn't get loaded in the broser and browser says that this is due to cross origin problem.
